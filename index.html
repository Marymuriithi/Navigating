      Beyond my senses, I leave more successful always, and simplifying things makes my dreams alive. In personal life right now I face an unprecedented level of complexity practically every moment of the day, but working harmony in every sense pulls/ load and reloads of information that I am getting every day around me.
      In times this part of our visual memory is constantly beyond what we see and we think this makes life more precious and being more than I am.

   	In the classes, we have covered more about how to handle things even when they are tough than usual. In the book Born A Crime, we have seen how the write predicted things before they had happened and visualizing for the dreams he had. Beyond the senses, I have a vision board that I have put down some images, big words which just a vision “dream” of what I wish to have after some year and that will be a move accomplished “I will make it since I am working on it”.
